The Essence of the iterator pattern - apper on traverse
traverse :: (Applicative f, Traversable t) => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)

Nothing
> traverse (\n -> if even n then Nothing else Just (n+1)) [1,3]
Just [2,4]

  :: (Applicative f, Traversable t, Traversable t1) =>
       (a -> f b) -> t (t1 a) -> f (t (t1 b))
